# QtileConfig

## Description
My personal QTile configuration files. I drew some inspiration from color schemes and ideas I saw on youtube, however, this is very much built to my personal taste. This configuration is quite minimal and still a work in progress. I tend to only add features that seem absolutely necessary for my every day use where my habits are usually just opening system files with a text editor to make most changes or use a desired shell command to output other information.

## Why QTile as my Window Manager?
I wanted to use a Tiling Window Manager that would allow me to add my own customizations in finer detail - i.e. a Window Manager that supported a robust programming language, in this case Python.

## Features
- High Contrast Color Theme (Dracula).  Easily swappable in the colors.py file.
- Widget Displays for internet traffic, CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and time.
- My personal keybinds.
- Screen Layouts (currently built for single or two monitor setups).
- Modular design.
